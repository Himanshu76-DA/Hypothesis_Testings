## 📊 Dataset Description

This dataset contains user transaction and demographic details. Below are the column descriptions:

- `ID` – Unique identifier for each user  
- `Gender` – Gender of the user  
- `Age` – Age of the user  
- `Income` – Annual income  
- `Education_Level` – User's education background  
- `City` – City of residence  
- `Product_Category` – Category of purchased product  
- `Purchase_Amount` – Amount spent in the transaction  
- `Purchase_Date` – Date of purchase  
- `Satisfaction_Score` – Feedback score (1–5)

## ✅ Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Fixed missing or inconsistent values  
   - Standardized formats (dates, categories, types)  
   - Handled outliers and obvious noise  

2. **Hypothesis Testing Performed**
   - ✅ One-Sample Z-Test  
   - ✅ One-Sample T-Test  
   - ✅ Two-Sample Z-Test  
   - ✅ Two-Sample T-Test  
   - ✅ ANOVA Test  
   - ✅ Chi-Square Test  

Each test was applied to explore relationships like income differences, category impact, satisfaction trends, and more.
